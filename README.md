## Features

- 🎬 **Universal resolver** — detects mp4/webm, HLS (`.m3u8`), DASH (`.mpd`), YouTube, and Vimeo from a raw URL and picks the right playback strategy
- 🔁 **Full manifest rewriting** — HLS and DASH segments, sub-playlists, and encryption keys are rewritten to route through the proxy, not just the top-level manifest
- 🛡️ **SSRF-guarded proxy** — blocks requests to private/internal IPs and cloud metadata endpoints, with DNS-rebind protection, an optional host allowlist, and per-IP rate limiting
- ⚡ **Manifest caching + auto-retry** — short-TTL in-memory cache for live manifests, one automatic retry on upstream 5xx/network errors
- ▶️ **Real embed control** — YouTube and Vimeo playback is driven through their official SDKs (IFrame API / Player SDK), so play/pause/seek/volume/speed all actually work, not just a static iframe
- ⏯️ **Continue watching** — resumes playback position per source URL via `localStorage`, with a subtle resume toast
- 🐢 **Playback speed control** — cycle 0.5x–2x, works across native video, YouTube, and Vimeo
- 📦 **Embeddable player** — drop `embed.js` into any page, zero build step
- 🧪 **Built-in test console** — live resolver output, proxy ping, and an event log for debugging playback

## Requirements

- Node.js 18+
- npm

## Setup

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Server runs on `http://localhost:3000` by default.

## Configuration

All optional — copy `.env.example` to `.env` and adjust as needed:

| Variable                     | Default | Description                                                                 |
| ----------------------------- | ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `CF_WORKER_URL`               | unset   | Route proxy requests through a Cloudflare Worker first (for IP-range blocks) |
| `PROXY_RATE_LIMIT_MAX`        | `60`    | Max proxy requests per IP per window                                        |
| `PROXY_RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW_MS`  | `60000` | Rate limit window, in milliseconds                                          |
| `PROXY_ALLOWED_HOSTS`         | unset   | Comma-separated host allowlist (e.g. `.example.com,cdn.example.org`). Leave empty to allow any public host |

The SSRF guard (blocking private IPs, localhost, and cloud metadata endpoints) is always on and isn't configurable.

## Testing

Go to `http://localhost:3000/test.html` — this is the dev testing page.

Paste any media URL into the input and hit Load. The panel shows:

- what the resolver detected (type, extension, whether it goes through the proxy)
- the resolved/proxy URL
- live playback state (buffering, stalled, errors, resolution, duration)
- a timestamped log of every event

**Proxy ping** — use the bottom input to test if a URL can be fetched through the proxy without loading it into the player.

### What works

- Direct video files (mp4, webm, etc.)
- HLS streams (.m3u8), including segment/key rewriting
- DASH streams (.mpd), including `BaseURL`/`SegmentList` rewriting
- YouTube and Vimeo, with full playback control via their official SDKs

### What doesn't

- TikTok, Instagram, Facebook — their video URLs are signed and loaded dynamically, can't be extracted without a headless browser or yt-dlp or something similar
- DASH `SegmentTemplate` streams using `$Number$`/`$Time$` placeholders — proxying these needs a path-based proxy scheme, not yet implemented

## Player

`http://localhost:3000/player.html` — the actual player. Accepts a `?url=` param so you can deep-link directly into it:

```
http://localhost:3000/player.html?url=https://example.com/video.mp4
```

Add `?debug=true` to show the URL input bar and status log inline.

## Embed

Drop this into any page to embed the player:

```html
<script src="http://localhost:3000/embed.js"></script>
```

## Proxy endpoint

`GET /proxy?url=<encoded-url>` — fetches and streams the target URL, with SSRF protection, rate limiting, HLS/DASH manifest rewriting, caching, and automatic retries.

## Cloudflare Worker proxy (optional)

Some target sites block requests based on IP range. To bypass that, requests can be routed through a Cloudflare Worker that acts as an egress proxy — separate repo, `UniplayOsproxy`.

Set `CF_WORKER_URL` in `.env` (see `.env.example`) once deployed:

```
CF_WORKER_URL=https://uniplay-proxy.your-subdomain.workers.dev
```

Without this variable set, the app proxies directly as normal — this is purely an optional egress layer.

Deploy steps and details live in the [UniplayOsproxy](https://github.com/unitedevz/UniplayOsproxy) repo README.

PRs welcome. Fork the repo, branch off `main`, and open a pull request describing what changed and why.

## Lostboy Contribution

Redesign of `public/index.html` — landing page only, no logic touched.

- Rebuilt the layout with staggered entrance animations (`rise`, `underline`, `pulse` keyframes) instead of a static page, kept the exact same color tokens (`--bg`, `--accent`, `--muted`, etc.) so it still matches the player
- Swapped every icon for Font Awesome (`fa-play`, `fa-flask`, `fa-file-video`, `fa-tower-broadcast`, `fa-diagram-project`, `fa-code`) — no emoji anywhere
- Added a live status badge with a pulsing dot, a two-button hero (Launch Player / Try the Resolver), and a four-item capability grid (MP4/WebM, HLS, DASH, Embeddable)
- Full responsive pass: 4-column feature grid collapses to 2 columns under 768px, action buttons stack full-width under 420px
- Respects `prefers-reduced-motion` — animations and transitions drop out entirely for users who ask for it
- Added proper SEO/meta: `<meta name="description">`, `<meta name="keywords">`, canonical link, Open Graph and Twitter card tags, and a `SoftwareApplication` JSON-LD block so the page is actually indexable and shareable
- Added a subtle SVG-based noise texture and radial accent glows in the background for depth, all done in pure CSS, no extra image assets
- Footer now links out to the GitHub repo instead of dead-ending
